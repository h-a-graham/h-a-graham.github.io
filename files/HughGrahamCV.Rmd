## Personal Statement

I am in the latter stages of writing up my PhD which I am doing alongside my work as a researcher in the Geography department at the University of Exeter. I study the impact of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver in Great Britain with a particular focus on how they affect [hydrological flow regimes](https://github.com/h-a-graham/Budleigh_Brook_Beaver_Hydro), [riparian woodland strucure](https://github.com/h-a-graham/CWC_Results_Analysis) and predicting the distribution of their habitat and dam building activity ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)). During my time at Exeter, I have developed a passion for programming and open source approaches to science and I would therefore love the opportunity to pursue this as a career.

Initially, my interest in coding was focused on statistics and data visualisation but, as I have developed as a programmer, the value and importance of structured, reproducible workflows and open source software has become clear. The power of science is in its utility and, without code, this can only be finite. I thoroughly enjoy helping others to find coding solutions; both in terms teaching others how to solve problems but also because I find that this dramatically improves my own learning through exposure to novel challenges.

I predominantly use R and Python for data analysis and software development. However, I would jump at any opportunity to learn new languages. Access to new problems and continuous learning are the aspects of programming that I enjoy the most.

As a researcher, working within a large group, I believe I have a strong understanding of the ways in which many in academia use programming software and the ways in which this can be improved.

Within our research group, I collaborate with many others across a diverse range of fields to improve the development of software, access to open source datasets and reproducible workflows. For example:

* I have recently developed an R package [{EAlidaR}](https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR) which enables users to download high resolution LiDAR data, produced by the Environment Agency, directly into R. As a research group we all use this data to undertake hydrological and vegetation modelling; however, manually downloading the data from DEFRA’s portal has always been a time-consuming and limiting factor. This package helps to overcome these issues. 

* Many of us within the research group use drone imagery to construct 3D models using Structure from Motion (SfM) Photogrammetry. In order to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of these models, I have developed two Python packages to streamline processing. Firstly [{sfm_precision}](https://github.com/exeter-creww/SFM_Precision/tree/master/sfm_precision), a python module for Agisoft Metashape, which calculates SFM precision entirely within Metashape using their Python API. This builds on [James et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.4125), who devised the method, but removes the need for multiple different programs and increases speed and storage efficiency. Secondly, [{sfm_gridz}](https://github.com/exeter-creww/SFM_Precision/tree/master/sfm_gridz) a python package to compute differences between elevation models, with consideration of each model’s precision and error.

* Much of the SFM work that we do is computationally intensive and I have therefore helped to move some of this processing to Exeter University's ISCA HPC facility as part of [Cunliffe, et al., 2020](http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.07.16.206011). This has been a really exciting project and I would enjoy the opportunity to further improve and develop my skills with HPC.

* There is also a need, within out group, to utilise Met Office NIMROD rainfall radar data. This dataset provides rainfall estimates at a 1km resolution nationally at 5 minute time steps. I have developed a [workflow](https://github.com/exeter-creww/Rainfall_radar) to download this data from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) FTP server and then process this for a user-specified region to retrieve rainfall time-series data which our group use for hydrological analysis/modelling.

Beyond work, I enjoy getting outdoors whenever possible, in particular I like to make the most of the South West's beaches and rivers by going spearfishing and kayaking.

## Employment

*University of Exeter – Researcher*\
*01/03/2019 – present* \
I am working in partnership with Natural England, The Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales and Scottish Natural Heritage to model Eurasian beaver habitat and estimate the distribution and density of their dams for Great Britain. This has required the upscaling of our previous work ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)), developed as part of my PhD, to a national scale. This requires the calculation of numerous hydrological, topographic and vegetation metrics from a range of remotely-sensed datasets using geospatial processing. Moving this workflow from the landscape to national scale has been very challenging but but hugely rewarding. Alongside this work, I have also produced an [ArcGIS plugin](https://github.com/exeter-creww/Beaver_Tools_ArcToolbox) which enables those using the model outputs to interrogate and extract relevant data and statistics. This process has required me to work closely with the geospatial teams across the partnership to develop a stable and user-friendly tool.  

*APEM ltd., Cardiff - Aquatic Consultant* \
*15/10/2014 - 01/10/2015* \
APEM ltd. is an aquatic consultancy specialising in both freshwater and marine environments. My key roles included: data analysis and visualisation, geospatial analysis and mapping with ArcGIS, report writing and field work.

*RMA environmental limited, Tiverton – Work Placement* \
*01/05/2013 – 14/06/2013* \
RMA environmental ltd. is an environmental consultancy. During my placement at RMA, I was responsible for report writing, mapping with QGIS software and data analysis.

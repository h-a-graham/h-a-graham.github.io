I am a geospatial/numerical modeler in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter (UoE). Using spatially distributed models, time series analysis, statistical analysis and remote sensing, I study the impact of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver in Great Britain with a particular focus on: riparian woodland structure ([Graham, et al., in review](https://github.com/h-a-graham/CWC_Results_Analysis)), hydrological flow regimes ([(Puttock, et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.14017)), modelling future population dynamics to understand ecological carrying capacity and the impact of varying management regimes ([Graham, et al., in review](https://github.com/h-a-graham/beavertools)) and predicting the spatial distribution of their habitat and dam building activity ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)). 

As I have progressed as a programmer, the value and importance of function-oriented workflows has become clear. I have learned how to make the code I write reproducible and generalisable so that it may be rapidly deployed in a variety of contexts, allowing me to increase my work efficiency and reduce the latency of desired outputs. Primarily, I have achieved this through the creation of my own software packages and use of pipeline toolkits such as the R package {targets}.

I mainly use R and Python for data analysis, visualisation and software development but also keen to learn something new! I  enjoy helping others to find coding solutions; in addition to taking enjoyment from other peoples' development, I find that this dramatically improves my own skills through exposure to novel challenges.

I am a big fan of open-source software for research; in particular, R, Python and QGIS.

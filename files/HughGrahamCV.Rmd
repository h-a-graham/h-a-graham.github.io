## Employment

**University of Exeter – Geospatial Research Assistant** (*01/03/2019 – present*)\
I am the lead geospatial data analyst on several research projects in partnership with Natural England, The Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Wildlife Trusts to model Eurasian beaver habitat and estimate the potential distribution and density of their dams for Great Britain. Building on our previous work ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)), developed as part of my PhD, I up-scaled the model for the entire British river network. This required the automated reading and processing of hydrological, topographic and vegetation metrics from a range of remotely-sensed datasets using a geospatial processing pipeline comprising Python, R and GRASS GIS. Moving this workflow from the landscape to national scale has taught me a huge amount in terms of designing stable workflows for processing big spatial data.

To accompany this work, I have produced an [ArcGIS plugin](https://github.com/exeter-creww/Beaver_Tools_ArcToolbox) and R shiny App to allow our partners to explore, interrogate and download the data. 

In this role I have also collaborated on a variety of other ecological and conservation projects such as:

><space>- Modelling Above ground biomass using drone-based Structure from Motion to create gloablly relevant allomtric models in low stature ecosystems [Cunliffe, et al., 2021](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.228)

><space>- Forest connectivity modelling, in partnership with Cornwall County Council, in support of their nature recovery program to evaluate the feasibility of species reintroductions. 

**APEM ltd., Cardiff - Aquatic Consultant** (*15/10/2014 - 01/10/2015*)\
 My key roles included: data analysis and visualisation using R, geospatial analysis and mapping with ArcGIS, report writing and field work.

**RMA Environmental Limited, Tiverton – Environmental Consultant** (*01/05/2013 – 14/06/2013*)\
During my placement at RMA, I was responsible for report writing, mapping (QGIS) and data analysis.

## Education

**2015-ongoing, University of Exeter  PhD** *(submission Decemeber 2021)*\
*PhD, Understanding the Impact of Reintroducing the Eurasian Beaver (Castor fiber) in Great Britain.*

Using spatially distributed models, time series analysis, statistical analysis and remote sensing, I study the impact of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver in Great Britain with a particular focus on: riparian woodland structure ([Graham, et al., in review](https://github.com/h-a-graham/CWC_Results_Analysis)), hydrological flow regimes ([(Puttock, et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.14017)), modelling future population dynamics to understand ecological carrying capacity and the impact of varying management regimes ([Graham, et al., in review](https://github.com/h-a-graham/beavertools)) and predicting the spatial distribution of their habitat and dam building activity ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)). 

**2013-2014, University of Birmingham** 
*MSc, River environments and their management (Dist.)* \
Dissertation - 78%: An investigation into the impact of the Demon Shrimp (*Dikerogammarus haemobaphes*) on the benthic invertebrate community of the River Cherwell. [Link to thesis](http://www.nonnativespecies.org/index.cfm?pageid=559)

**2009 -2012, University of Exeter**
*BSc (Hons), Geography (2:1)*\
Dissertation - 78%: A laboratory flume experiment investigating the interaction between bed-load transport, erosion and channel geomorphology.

## Key Qualifications/Skills

### *- Very strong proficiency with R and Python programming languages:*

- I have focused much of my learning, whilst at UoE on improving my programming skills with a particular focus on geospatial. The following projects illustrate the range of data that I work with across a variety of different environmental disciplines:

- [{EAlidaR}](https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR), an R package that enables users to download high resolution LiDAR data, produced by the Environment Agency, directly into R. I, and our research group, use this data to undertake hydrological and vegetation modelling; however, manually downloading from the data portal is very time-consuming; this package helps to overcome this. The package has been used to increase efficiency in the identification of archaeological features and has been used in a recent academic publication [Rhodes, et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12802).

-  Our research group frequently use Met Office NIMROD rainfall radar data. These data consist of national-scale rainfall rate estimates at a 1km resolution and 5 minute time steps. I developed a [workflow](https://github.com/exeter-creww/Rainfall_radar) using Python and R to download this data from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) FTP server and process it for user-specified regions to retrieve large rainfall time-series data. The workflow has been used for several projects including: [Upstream Thinking](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/casestudies/upstreamthinking/), [Whole Catchment](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/casestudies/wholecatchment/), [Mires Project](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/casestudies/miresproject/) and [Puttock, et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.14017) .

-  [{rayvista}](https://github.com/h-a-graham/rayvista) is an R package that enables rapid access to geospatial data for generating 2.5D and hillshade visulasations. This project has received wide community engagement and the package is freuently downloaded 

-  I have contributed to open source projects. For example, I provided a patch for the the widely used [{maptiles}](https://github.com/riatelab/maptiles) R package and I have also helped to develop a web app called [Is The Dart Running?](http://isthedartrunning.co.uk/) which uses a machine learning approach to predict the water level of the River Dart (SW England) to determine if the river is high enough to kayak.

### *- Extensive experience with version control*
- I use Git version control sotware and [GitHub](https://github.com/h-a-graham) on a daily basis to manage and track the progress of my software development, report writing and data analysis. 

### *- Mapping and spatial analysis in Google Earth Engine, QGIS, GRASS GIS, Arc GIS/Pro and their respective python APIs*
- I have been using a wide range of GIS software for >8 years and have gained a strong background in fundamental concepts such as coordinate reference systems, geographic transformations, raster and spatial vector processing and the use of SQL to calculate efficient spatial queries. 

### *- Experience with High Performance Computing*
- SfM work is often computationally intensive and I have therefore helped to move some of this processing to UoE's ISCA High Performance Computing (HPC) facility as part of [Cunliffe, et al., 2020](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.228). This required the scheduling of distributed computing using the command line in combination with Python. I would enjoy the opportunity to further advance my skills with HPC, particularly for cloud-based processing.

### *- Extensive experience with Agisoft Metashape SfM photogrammetry software and its Python API*
- I work extensively with drone-based Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to understand changes in vegetation structure. In order to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of these models, I have developed two Python packages to streamline processing:

><space>- [{sfm_precision}](https://github.com/exeter-creww/SFM_Precision/tree/master/sfm_precision) a python module for Agisoft Metashape, which calculates SfM precision using Metashape's Python API. This builds on [James et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.4125), by improving computational performance and allowing greater scalability.

><space>- [{sfm_gridz}](https://github.com/exeter-creww/SFM_Precision/tree/master/sfm_gridz) a python package to compute differences between digital elevation models with consideration of each model’s precision and error. These packages are extremely useful when working in structurally complex systems where an accurate understanding of uncertainty is critical. These packages were developed as part of our in review manuscript: "Using aerial photogrammetry to detect significant canopy height change resulting from beaver foraging."

### *- Strong statistical analysis skills*
- I have experience applying a wide range of statistical techniques including: General Linear Models, Mixed effects models, General Additive Models, Principal Component Analysis, Quantile regression, Bayesian regression and Fuzzy inference. Many members of our research group, of >20 people, reach out to me for advice and discussion on the application of statistical methods.

### *- Cartography*
- I enjoy using code for cartography. Some recent examples of my maps can be found [here](https://github.com/h-a-graham/Hugh-30DayMapChallenge).

### *- Experience piloting drones to undertake Structure from Motion surveys.*

### *- Full and clean driving License*

## Personal Statement

I am in the final stages of writing up my PhD (submission date December 2021) which I have been doing alongside my work as a geospatial/numerical modeler in the department of  Geography at the University of Exeter (UoE). Using spatially distributed models, time series data analysis, statistical analysis and remote sensing data, I study the impact of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver in Great Britain with a particular focus on: riparian woodland structure ([Graham, et al., in review](https://github.com/h-a-graham/CWC_Results_Analysis)), hydrological flow regimes ([(Puttock, et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.14017)), projecting population future population changes under varying management ([Graham, et al., in review](https://github.com/h-a-graham/beavertools)) and predicting the distribution of their habitat and dam building activity ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)). During my time at UoE, I have focused much of my learning on programming, geospatial software/technologies and open source approaches to science; I hope to pursue these interests further in my career.

As I have progressed as a programmer, the value and importance of function-oriented workflows has become clear. I have learned how to make the code I write reproducible and generalisable so that it may be rapidly deployed in a variety of contexts, allowing me to increase my work efficiency and reduce the latency of desired outputs. Primarily, I have achieved this through the creation of my own software packages and use of pipeline toolkits such as the R package {targets}.

I predominantly use R and Python for data analysis/visualisation and software development. However, I have proven myself adept at self-learning code when needed and would relish any opportunity to learn new languages. I  enjoy helping others to find coding solutions; in addition to taking enjoyment out of other people's development I find that this dramatically improves my own skills through exposure to novel challenges. Access to these new problems and continuous learning are the aspects of programming that I enjoy the most.

I have formed many collaborations, across a diverse range of fields, to develop a variety of software, For example:

* An R package [{EAlidaR}](https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR) which enables users to download high resolution LiDAR data, produced by the Environment Agency, directly into R. As a research group we use this data to undertake hydrological and vegetation modelling; however, manually downloading from the data portal has always been a time-consuming and limiting factor; this package helps to overcome these issues. 

* I work extensively with drone-based Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to understand changes in vegetation structure. In order to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of these models, I have developed two Python packages to streamline processing. Firstly, [{sfm_precision}](https://github.com/exeter-creww/SFM_Precision/tree/master/sfm_precision) a python module for Agisoft Metashape, which calculates SfM precision entirely within Metashape using their Python API. This builds on [James et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.4125), who devised the method, but removes the need for multiple different programs and increases speed and storage efficiency. Secondly, [{sfm_gridz}](https://github.com/exeter-creww/SFM_Precision/tree/master/sfm_gridz) a python package to compute differences between digital elevation models with consideration of each model’s precision and error. These packages are extremely useful when working in structurally complex systems where an accurate understanding of uncertainty is critical. These packages were developed as part of our in review manuscript: "Using aerial photogrammetry to detect significant canopy height change resulting from beaver foraging."

* SfM work is often computationally intensive and I have therefore helped to move some of this processing to Exeter University's ISCA HPC facility as part of [Cunliffe, et al., 2020](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.228). This has been a really exciting project and I would enjoy the opportunity to further improve and develop my skills with HPC, particularly for cloud-based processing.

* Within our group, there is also a need to use Met Office NIMROD rainfall radar data. This dataset provides rainfall estimates at a 1km resolution nationally at 5 minute time steps. I have developed a [workflow](https://github.com/exeter-creww/Rainfall_radar) to download this data from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) FTP server and process it for user-specified regions to retrieve large rainfall time-series data >10 years at a 5 minute resolution. The workflow has been used for several projects including: [Upstream Thinking](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/casestudies/upstreamthinking/), [Whole Catchment](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/casestudies/wholecatchment/), [Mires Project](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/casestudies/miresproject/) and [Puttock, et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.14017) .

Beyond work, I enjoy getting outdoors whenever possible, in particular I like to make the most of our local beaches and rivers by going spearfishing and kayaking. In fact, I have also contributed to an open source project called [Is The Dart Running?](http://isthedartrunning.co.uk/) which uses a machine learning approach to predict the water level of the River Dart to determine if the river is high enough to kayak. I enjoy using code for cartography in my spare time and have developed an R package ([{rayvista}](https://github.com/h-a-graham/rayvista)) to allow greater access to geospatial data for generating 2.5D map renders and hillshade maps. Some recent examples of my maps can be found [here](https://github.com/h-a-graham/Hugh-30DayMapChallenge).

## Employment

*University of Exeter – Researcher*\
*01/03/2019 – present* \
I have been working in partnership with Natural England, The Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Wildlife Trusts to model Eurasian beaver habitat and estimate the distribution and density of their dams for Great Britain. This has required the upscaling of our previous work ([Graham, et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10344-020-01379-w)), developed as part of my PhD, to a national scale. This required the calculation of numerous hydrological, topographic and vegetation metrics from a range of remotely-sensed datasets using geospatial processing. Moving this workflow from the landscape to national scale has been very challenging but hugely rewarding. Alongside this work, I have also produced an [ArcGIS plugin](https://github.com/exeter-creww/Beaver_Tools_ArcToolbox) which enables those using the model outputs to interrogate and extract relevant data and statistics. This process has required me to work closely with the geospatial teams across the partnership to develop a stable and user-friendly tool. 

*APEM ltd., Cardiff - Aquatic Consultant* \
